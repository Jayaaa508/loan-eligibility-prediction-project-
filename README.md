# Loan-eligibility-prediction-project-
Learn how to predict if a person will be able to pay the loan with classification algorithm using python library for machine learning.
This project aims to predict loan eligibility using various machine learning approaches. By analyzing customer data, we determine whether a loan application should be approved or denied. Multiple techniques are implemented and compared, including traditional machine learning algorithms and advanced deep learning models.
